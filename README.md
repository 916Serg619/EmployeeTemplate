# EmployeeTemplate
For this project, I had to create a team template utilizing node.js

## Description
The application will begin with a prompt asking the user to select a job role.  From there, the user is asked to input various information related to that employee. Once all employees are documented, an html site will be generated, and the information can be seen there.

## Successes/Shortcomings
After my first successful template creation, I had ran in to a couple issues trying to fix a couple small bugs.  This led to my many errors.  Luckily, my main issue that was preventing my application from running was only a syntax error, which I quickly corrected.  The bugs I could not figure out are in the "Engineer" and "Intern" sections.  when asked for the Engineer's github username, and the school that the Intern attended,  the information that the user inputs does not populate.  Instead, they both show up as "undefined".
