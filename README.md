# EmployeeTemplate
For this project, I had to create a team template utilizing node.js

## Description
The application will begin with a prompt asking the user to select a job role.  From there, the user is asked to input various information related to that employee. Once all employees are documented, an html site will be generated, and the information can be seen there.

## Successes/Shortcomings
I have been successful in generating a team template only once.  Many unusual errors were popping up during my tests, and I was able to get 100% pass only once.  I restarted VS Code, my machine, checked syntax, but no luck. this may be due to me installing dependencies over and over again, hoping for different results.  I have screenshots to verify my one success, my work, as well as my errors.
